  ;; The exclamation mark (or bang) on a function like swap! means

  ;; Side effects (may) get triggered multiple times because of conflicts
  ;; depending on how far a transaction progressed before the conflict occurred.
  ;; This is quite the unpleasant combination.
  ;; Therefore we should only use pure functions in transactions if possible!

  ;; There is no sequence f1, f2 in which this is possible.

  ;; read-only accesses are not included in the set of conflicts...

  ;; You could manually provoke a conflict, by replacing the read value with itself:

  ;; the deref in other transactions fails immediately.
