  ;; agents

  ;; agents are uncoordinated and asynchronous.
  ;; - asynchronous: calls return immediately; action may still have to take place.
  ;; - uncoordinated: you cannot read or write two agents consistently. So do not even try.

  ;; here we use 'send-off' instead of send:
  ;; 'send-off' creates a new thread for every task

  ;; so this will only take a second
  (time
   (do
     (doseq [a ag] (send-off a (fn [_] (Thread/sleep 1000))))
     (doseq [a ag] (await a))))


  ;; When exceptions are thrown in functions executed by agents, they go into hiding
  ;; and do accept any more tasks
  (def agent-x (agent 0))
  (send agent-x (fn [state] (/ 0 0)))

  ;; Note: the :status has changed to :failed
  agent-x
  (send agent-x inc)

  ;; You have to restart the agent
  (restart-agent agent-x 0)
  (send agent-x inc)

  ;; With atoms the caller gets the exception.
  ;; With agents the caller has already moved on.
