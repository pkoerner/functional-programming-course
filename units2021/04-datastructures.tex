\section{Learning Outcomes}

After completing this unit you should be able to

\begin{itemize}
	\item describe the implementation of lists, vectors, sets and maps in Clojure.
    \item recall the runtime characteristics of various operations on lists, vectors, sets and maps.
    \item explain structural sharing, immutability and their interplay.
    \item identify possibilities for structural sharing for given data structures and operations.
    \item describe the concept of laziness.
    \item decide which calculations in Clojure are evaluated immediately and which are (or can be) delayed.
    \item differentiate between implicit and explicit laziness and explain the difference.
    %\item read destructurings of data structures and specify the binding of symbols.
    %\item write recursive programs yourself

\section{Exercises}
\begin{exercise}[Hash Trie]

	In this exercise we consider a hash trie with a branching factor of 4,
	meaning every node has at most 4 children.
	Assume the following hash values for this exercise:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l@{}ll@{}l}
        hash(:a)    &= \colorbox{red!15}{00}\colorbox{blue!15}{10}\colorbox{orange!15}{00}\colorbox{green!15}{00} &hash(:e)    &= \colorbox{red!15}{10}\colorbox{blue!15}{01}\colorbox{orange!15}{11}\colorbox{green!15}{01}\\
        hash(:b)    &= \colorbox{red!15}{10}\colorbox{blue!15}{00}\colorbox{orange!15}{00}\colorbox{green!15}{10} &hash(:new)  &= \colorbox{red!15}{00}\colorbox{blue!15}{01}\colorbox{orange!15}{01}\colorbox{green!15}{10}\\
        hash(:c)    &= \colorbox{red!15}{01}\colorbox{blue!15}{11}\colorbox{orange!15}{10}\colorbox{green!15}{10} &hash(:ouch) &= \colorbox{red!15}{11}\colorbox{blue!15}{01}\colorbox{orange!15}{11}\colorbox{green!15}{01}\\
        hash(:d)    &= \colorbox{red!15}{11}\colorbox{blue!15}{00}\colorbox{orange!15}{01}\colorbox{green!15}{00} &\\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{hashtrie.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item
	Which map is stored in the pictured trie?
\item
	How many bits are needed for determining the position in an array?
\item
	Insert the value \texttt{:ez} under key \texttt{:new}.
	Which nodes can be referenced in the previous trie and which have to be copied?
\item
	Insert the value \texttt{:almost-a-collision} under key \texttt{:ouch}.
	Which nodes can be referenced in the previous trie and which have to be copied?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Maxima]

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item
  Define a function, that returns the maximum of its arguments.
\begin{verbatim}
(max-value 3 42 1336 12.5)
=> 1336
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Define a function that returns the first, longest sequence of its arguments. Nesting should not be considered.
\begin{verbatim}
(longest []  [:a :b 12] [[1 2 3 4 5 6]])
=> [:a :b 12]
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Define a function that determines the maximal length of its arguments. Nesting should not be considered.
\begin{verbatim}
(max-length []  [:a :b 12] [[1 2 3 4 5 6]])
=> 3
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}[Matrix]
In the following exercise, we consider a matrix as a vector of row vectors. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
(def identity-matrix [[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]])
(def matrix2 [[1 0 0 1] [0 1 0 1] [0 0 1 1]])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Write a function \verb|p!|, which outputs the matrix.
\begin{verbatim}
user=> (p! identity-matrix)
100
010
001
\end{verbatim}
  
\item Write a function \verb|trans|, which transposes the matrix, i.e. swaps the rows and columns:
\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= identity-matrix (trans identity-matrix))
true
user=> (p! (trans matrix2))
100
010
001
111
user=> (= matrix2 (trans matrix2))
false
user=> (= matrix2 (trans (trans matrix2)))
true 
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Black Box Testing (4clojure \#65)]
	Clojure has different collections, which differ (slightly) in their behaviour.
	Functions in \verb|clojure.core| typically transform them into sequences and work on them.
	It is nonetheless important to understand the differences in behaviour and performance 
	to choose an appropriate representation for given data.

    Write a function \verb|data-type|, which takes a collection as parameter and returns \verb|:map|, \verb|:set|, \verb|:list| or \verb|:vector|
    depending on which type of collection was passed.

	It is prohibited to use the \verb|list?| predicate.
	The point of this exercise is to play around with collections and understand their behaviour.
\end{exercise}
