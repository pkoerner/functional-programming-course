	\section*{Note}
	The learning objectives indicate what is expected of you in the exam.
	In principle it does not matter which material you consult to achieve the learning objective.
	The deadline allows you to meaningfully participate in the exercises.
	
	Solving the exercises is voluntary.
	The exercises in this guide present tools and as such are elementary for subsequent course material.
	In addition these tools are an immense help for solving the exercises.
	
	You are free to proceed to the next unit, as soon as you complete this one.  
	
	\paragraph{Timeline:} This unit should be completed by 12.04.2022.
